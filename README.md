# First year website portfolio
This website was created as part of a first year assignment that was meant to show different CSS stylesheets, this function can be used by using the dropdown at the bottom of the page in order to switch between different stylesheets to see the change in the website. You may have to toggle a couple of times to make the stylesheets swap while it grabs the styles.
